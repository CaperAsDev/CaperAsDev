- 👋 Hi, I’m @Caperactus
- 👀 I’m interested in web development and art.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development in a online platform call Platzi
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything XD i´m still learning the fundamentals but i will be happyto learn with and from other people.
- 📫 How to reach me: caperactus@gmail.com but to be honest i don´t check my email frequently so it would be better if you dm me on my social network as Caperactus.
